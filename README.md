# Power-List

Hello, This is my first real python project that doesn't just copy a tutorial.   

This is an app that will track daily wins and losses.  TLDR -- Finish five core task that you set, you win the day.   Fail to do all five, you lost.  


I'd first like to say that this powerlist Python project is my attempt to digitalize how I personally stay productive. 
This idea is taken/influenced from Andy Frisella, a mentor and someone who I look up to and aspire to be like.   

The concept of the power list is as follows: How does one have a good life?   I think when one wins at life, they have a good life.
How does one win at life?   First you gotta win more than you lose in life.  How do you win more than you lose?  Say you only live to 100 years.  
Start by winning the Century.  How do you win the century?  Start by winning more in the Half century.  How do you win in the half century?  
You win more decades in the half century than you lose.   How do you win the decade then?   You win more years than you lose in decade.  
How do you win a year?   You win more months than you lose.   How do you win the month?  You win more weeks than you lose? 
How do you win the week?  You win more days in the week than you lose in the week.  
How do you win the day?  

You set your power list and you accomplish every task on that list.   

Generally speaking (5 tasks).   On top of your everyday normal things, if you set out to accomplish Five core tasks per day, you win the day.
Everyone has different "standards" for winning and different metrics so it's uniquely individual for everyone!  
One person's core task might be to spend an hour learning a different language or spending an hour to develop a new skill.
If you are a person who isn't used to winning, you can lower the bar and pick simple things, but as long as you finish whatever five core things you set your mind to,
you will still win the day no matter how bad the day might turn out. 
A person can even set up something like brushing their teeth as a task or make the bed!   Everyone's metric for success and items are always going to be different. 
But through acumulating wins, eventually the wins will add up and lead to a really successful life, whatever you define as "successful" 

Thus this is an app that is designed to track wins and losses. 

The basic concept is having a calendar.  
If you finished five core task (whatever the user inputs as their core tasks), they can check it off.  
When all five items are checked off, they "won" the day.  

If they failed to finish all five, they "lost" the day.   

Ideally I would like to turn this into an app that I can carry this with me. 



To do --- Turn this concept into an app.  Phone app.  And PC that's integrated eventually.
